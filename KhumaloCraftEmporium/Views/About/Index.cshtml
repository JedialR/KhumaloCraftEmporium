                    James Khumalo, a visionary entrepreneur, set out to establish KhumaloCraft Emporium as a global e-commerce platform to showcase handcrafted products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His dream involves connecting artisans worldwide with a discerning audience. However, for this dream to become reality, KhumaloCraft Emporium needs a scalable, accessible, and user-friendly platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Achieving this requires an understanding of basic cloud computing and the various service models; and a platform that is accessible globally, which is usable and ensures a positive user experience. Once the craftwork and its related details have been built into a suitable platform to showcase the work, it is necessary that the platform be deployed to enable accessibility and advertising the work.

                <p>
                    James envisioned a platform accessible to a global audience, scalable to accommodate growth, and ensuring a secure and enjoyable shopping experience. The challenges include making crucial decisions on cloud service models and deployment strategies, as well as designing an efficient database schema for product information and user data, while ensuring scalability with the platform's growth. The development team faces technical challenges such as global accessibility, scalability, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
